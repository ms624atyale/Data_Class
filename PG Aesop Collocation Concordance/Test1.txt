THE WOLF AND THE KID


There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he
was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So
one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his
mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling
the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the
flock was gone.

He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping
over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them
making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought
of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field,
bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees,
there was the Wolf!

The Kid knew there was little hope for him.
